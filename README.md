This package is designed to analyze and visualize crosslinking (XL) data from multiple sources (mainly BS3 and UV).

**Analysis**

-   Differential analysis

-   Crosslinking frequency

-   Creation of represental PDB files for missing peptides

-   Mutation and Uniprot Integration (*coming soon!*)

**BS3**

-   Control distances for PDB structures

**RBDMap**

-   Frequency of RNA-likened amino acids

**Visualization**

-   Distance histograms

-   Amino acid frequency heatmaps

-   2D: xiNET output

-   3D: PyMOL output

Installation
